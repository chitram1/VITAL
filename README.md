# VITAL
VITAL: Validated Text-Mining Using Advanced Language Model

In order to run the experiments for the VITAL framework, we ran experiments on an Amazon Web Server (AWS). In order to run the CaseOLAP files below, you will need to clone the following repo: https://github.com/CaseOLAP/caseolap

Steps 1-5 delineated in the CaseOLAP repository are for getting the data set up from PubMed, but steps 6 and onward are more experiment dependent. In the Python notebook included in this repo, we will assume the necessary steps were completed in CaseOLAP up until step 5.

Step 6 and onward are unique to the experiment that is described in our research paper with the specific categories and entities of interest that we will be using.
